# Yearbook App Sample

This is a sample app for managing yearbook orders.

## Features

This app should allow users to:

* View Landing page
* Place a yearbook order with some customization options
* View the list of all orders placed
* Edit and Delete existing orders

## Building

This app should be buildable with the .car and .sql files included in the `build` folder. The datasource password for postgres used should be "test", although this may want to be changed when connecting to your own database. The src should also be importable into your ColdFusion webserver directory.
